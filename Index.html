<h1>Society for Velociraptor Attack Prevention</h1>
<p> Velociraptor attack is the 3rd leading cause of death for men age 27-29. 
However, everyone must think about the implications of velociraptors: 
young and old, men, women and transgendered persons.
</p>
<p> American Society for Velociraptor Attack Prevention is a bi-partisan 
group of professionals, dedicated to the diffusion of knowledge concerning 
velociraptor attack prevention.

<h2>Know the Enemy
</h2>
<p>The velociraptor is a bipedal carnivore with a long, stiffened tail and 
can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull, 
with an upturned snout. It has a relatively large, sickle-shaped claw, 
typical of dromaeosaurid and troodontid dinosaurs. This enlarged claw, up 
to 67 millimeters (2.6 in) long around its outer edge, is a predatory 
device, used to tear into the prey, delivering a fatal blow.
</p>
<p>Velociraptors are commonly found on tropical islands, converted to 
millionaire amusement parks, but are commonly being sighted in the Pacific Northwest.

assessing potential velociraptor attacks:
Check all doors and windows. Doors should be made of solid oak or steel. 
Windows should have steel bars with spacing smaller than the average 
raptor.

purchased at your local Home Depot.

every door. Remember, you should never be farther than 20 feet away from a 
tire iron.
